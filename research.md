### Epistemic Scapegoating

_In Preparation._ How does prejudicial credibility excess (PCE) wrong its victims in their capacity as knowers? I argue that PCE gives rise to _epistemic scapegoating_. Credibility excesses lead hearers to form epistemically blameworthy beliefs. But through structural prejudices, these hearers can exculpate themselves of epistemic blame, instead directing wrongful epistemic blame onto the victims of PCE.
