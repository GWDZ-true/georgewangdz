I am a philosophy student at the University of Cambridge. My main research interests are in formal, social, and normative epistemology, and the intersections of epistemology with ethics and philosophy of language. Please feel free to check out my [CV](https://www.georgewangdz.com/assets/cv.pdf "CV") or my current [research projects](https://www/georgewangdz.com/research "research projects").
